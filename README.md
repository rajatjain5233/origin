Hi this is the sample app for demonstrating the excercise that was provided in the documentation.
for running the app on your local 
first clone the repo and branch in your local by 

git clone https://github.com/rajatjain5233/origin.git --branch rajat_branch --single-branch

now after running this command there will be a folder in your local named origin
go into the folder named origin 

run 

npm cache clean --force

npm install

npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

For any problems you can anytime ping me on jain.rajat5233@gmail.com 
Have a good day
